# Visualiser for the Chase Algorithm

## Description

The Visualiser for the Chase Algorithm is a web app that allows users to use the Chase 
algorithm to perform various tasks such as testing for entailment of dependencies, 
lossless decomposition and minimal cover; and finding projected dependencies on a fragment.

## Getting Started

### Installing

The Visualiser for the Chase Algorithm is a self-contained application. The only setup necessary 
is to copy the "the-chase" folder into your webserver.

### Executing program

To open the Visualiser for the Chase Algorithm, open the "chase.html" webpage that is hosted in 
your webserver. The sample input XML file for each task is located in the "sample-xml-inputs" folder 
in this repository. There is a one-to-one mapping for the sample input files. E.g. To execute the 
entailment task, you can input "entailment_1.xml" into the web application.
